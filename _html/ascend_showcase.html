            <p>Ascend BKC is a Korean-American college ministry and community with a vision to help others experience God's love. Whether they pursue this vision through Sunday services, bible studies, or even basketball, you can find out all about it on this site.</p>

            <hr>
            <p>The making of this website was my introduction to WordPress. I developed this website with the intention of appealing to newcomers and current members alike. Where newcomers would feel welcomed and find many oppurtunites to see what Ascend is all about, current members could easily navigate the site to find what's new and upcoming.

          <hr>
          <p>For newcomers of Ascend BKC, they will be greeted with the nav bar at the top. The nav bar is seperated by the Ascend logo, splitting it into two parts. The left side consists of sections that newcomers would likely visit: home, about us, and gatherings. <br><br> The home page is the default page that visitors will be directed to. It covers all the sections breifly and gives a path to learn more about each section. There is not too much information to overwhelm the visitor, but enough to capture thier attention. It is tailored to help newcomers go to the about us, gatherings, or contacts page. <br><br> The about us page gives the visitor a more in-depth description of what Ascend BKC is all about. The vision and mission statement reside here as well. It has all the information a newcomer would need to visit the church such as the service times, staff they can contact, and a map to the church with directions.<br><br> The gatherings page consists of all the main ways that newcomers can get involved with Ascend. The page has information on "The Bridge", Ascend's bible study, and a small faqs section for it. There is also info on basketball gatherings and how to join them. Just like the about us page, a map with directions is given at the end of this page to give the visitor a welcoming atmosphere.

          <h1>Member's Perspective</h1>
          <hr>
          <p>For current members of Ascend BKC, they will be greeted with the nav bar at the top. The nav bar is seperated by the Ascend logo, splitting it into two parts. The right side consists of sections that members would usually visit: events, sermons, and contacts. <br><br> The events page has upcoming events that Ascend BKC will be hosting, making it a valuable source of information for members who want to take part in them. The events page shows what the event is, the date the event is taking place, and more details of the event. <br><br> The sermons page at this time does not have anything on it because of the lack of sermons. However, once Ascend records enough sermons, the page will be an archive of past sermons including the most recent one. Here visitors will be able to see/hear a video of the sermon. Details on who gave the sermon and what it might be about can also be found here. <br><br> The contacts page has your typical contact form that will send a direct email to the Ascend BKC email. Although it could be used for newcomers to ask questions or comments, it can also be used for members to ask for prayer requests or comments regarding church matters. To encourage the latter, the contact form does not require a name or email address to submit.
